## Description

This application utilizes mysql and inquirer to help companies keep track of their employees by roles, department, salary and track who their manager is. I felt like I didn't really know what I was doing when I first started this project, so basically how I feel everytime I start a new assignment. After going through the homework demos and reqtching some material I got the hang of it and the work started to flow. Async functions really helped make this flow!
